# Multilayer-perceptron-from-scratch-using-python 
Multilayer perceptrone from scratch for binary classification, I implement 2 activation functions: ReLu and sigmoid, moreover mean square error was implemented as a loss function, which in turn was optimized by gradient descent computed with backpropagation.
